# 🧠 AI Bot Embedded Crossword

A traditional **crossword game** enhanced with an AI twist — users provide a prompt, and the AI bot fills the crossword grid with relevant words. Built using **C++ and OpenGL**, this project combines classic puzzle-solving with modern intelligent systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🧩 Traditional crossword mechanics with a twist of AI interaction  
- 💬 Users input a **custom prompt** (e.g., "Space", "Technology", "History")  
- 🤖 An AI bot processes the prompt and **fills the crossword** with relevant words  
- 🧱 Built using **C++** and **OpenGL** for rendering and interaction  

> **Duration:** Aug 2024 – Dec 2024  
> **Tech Stack:** C++, OpenGL

## 🎮 Features

- 🧠 AI-generated crossword content based on user-defined themes
- 🎨 Graphical UI built with OpenGL
- ⌨️ Interactive grid system with keyboard controls
- 💡 Designed for fun, education, and replayability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
